    To the question "What is your name?"
    which has a more unambiguous answer in
    the contemporary West, the only
    plausible answer is "It depends."

    Part of our emergency is that it’s so
    awfully tempting to do this sort of
    thing now, to retreat to narrow
    arrogance, pre-formed positions, rigid
    filters, the “moral clarity” of the
    immature. The alternative is dealing
    with massive, high-entropy amounts of
    info and ambiguity and conflict and
    flux; it’s continually discovering new
    vistas of personal ignorance and
    delusion. In sum, to really try to be
    informed and literate today is to feel
    stupid nearly all the time, and to need
    help. That’s about as clearly as I can
    put it.
