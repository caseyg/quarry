    In virtual words and computer games,
    people are flattened into personae. On
    social networks, people are reduced to
    their profiles. On our mobile devices,
    we often talk to each other on the move
    and with little disposable time—so
    little, in fact, that we communicate in
    a new language of abbreviation in which
    letters stand for words and emoticons

    Wilson’s way of keeping in mind the

    whatever intelligence machines may
    achieve, it will never be the kind that
    people have because no body given to a
    machine will be a human body. Therefore,
    the machine’s intelligence, no matter
    how interesting, will be alien."

    The questions for the future are not
    whether children will love their robot
    companions more than their pets or even
    their parents. The questions are rather,
    What will love be? And what will it mean
    to achieve ever-greater intimacy with
    our machines? Are we ready to see
    ourselves in the mirror of the machine
    and to see love as our performances of
    love?"

    when we make a job rote, we are more
    open to having machines do it. But even
    when people do it, they and the people
    they serve feel like machines."

    Japanese roboticists are fond of
    pointing out that in their country, even
    worn-out sewing needles are buried with
    ceremony. At some shrines in Japan,
    dolls, including sex dolls, are given
    proper burials. It is commonplace to
    think of the inanimate as having a life
    force. If a needle has a soul, why
    shouldn’t a robot?"

    She confessed that it is ever more
    difficult to begin her spiritual
    exercises before she checks her e-mail;
    the discipline to defer opening her
    inbox is now part of her devotional
    gesture."

    Robotics and connectivity call each
    other up in tentative symbiosis,
    parallel pathways to relational retreat.
    With sociable robots we are alone but
    receive the signals that tell us we are
    together. Networked, we are together,
    but so lessened are our expectations of
    each other that we can feel utterly
    alone. And there is the risk that we
    come to see others as objects to be
    accessed—and only for the parts we
    find useful, comforting, or amusing."

    At a café a block from my home, almost
    everyone is on a computer or smartphone
    as they drink their coffee. These people
    are not my friends, yet somehow I miss

    Today, our machine dream is to be never
    alone but always in control. This
    can’t happen when one is face-to-face
    with a person. But it can be
    accomplished with a robot or, as we
    shall see, by slipping through the
    portals of a digital life."

    We may begin by thinking that e-mails,
    texts, and Facebook messaging are thin
    gruel but useful if the alternative is
    sparse communication with the people we
    care about. Then, we become accustomed
    to their special pleasures—we can have
    connection when and where we want or
    need it, and we can easily make it go
    away. In only a few more steps, you have
    people describing life on Facebook as
    better than anything they have ever
    known."

    things move from “I have a feeling, I
    want to make a call” to “I want to
    have a feeling, I need to make a
    call,” or in her case, send a text.
    What is not being cultivated here is the
    ability to be alone and reflect on
    one’s emotions in private."

    “If Facebook were deleted, I’d be
    deleted.... All my memories would
    probably go along with it. And other
    people have posted pictures of me. All
    of that would be lost. If Facebook were
    undone, I might actually freak out....
    That is where I am. It’s part of your
    life. It’s a second you.”"

    In this group, there is near consensus
