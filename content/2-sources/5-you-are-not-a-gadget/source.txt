    the Turing test cuts both ways. You

    degree that the machine seems smart. If
    you can have a conversation with a

    MySpace preserved some of that flavor,

    Wikipedia seeks to erase point of view
    entirely. If a church or government were
    doing these things, it would feel
    authoritarian, but when technologists
    are the culprits, we seem hip, fresh,

    The mere possibility of there being
    something ineffable about personhood is
    what drives many technologists to reject
    the notion of quality. They want to live
    in an airtight reality that resembles an
    idealized computer program, in which
    everything is understood and there are
    no fundamental mysteries. They recoil

    it seems pointless to insist that what

    I don’t think I’m necessarily any

    interface designs that arise from the
    ideology of the computing cloud make
    people—all of us—less kind. Trolling
    is not a string of isolated incidents,
    but the status quo in the online world."
  comment: "Perhaps it *is* due to the interface conventions (signifiers or affordances, in Norman's terms e.g. easy anonymity) but I also found it interesting that Alex Wright chalked bad behavior up to a kind of hysteria like when printed texts began to spread, though that explanation of people ripping each others hearts out because of BOOKS is a lot harder to buy into. like in Objectified when they talk about the decoupling of form and function: a black rectangle with an abstract concept called the Internet on it, the malleability and abstraction of software provides challenges in communicating function (a reason for skeuomorphism) AND a tremendous responsibility because you have no physical constraints on what can be built. Designers of software must be masters of restraint."

    The reason I call this an expression of
    ideology is that there is a strenuously
    constructed lattice of arguments that
    decorate this murderous behavior so that
    it looks grand and new. If the same
    researchers had done something similar
    without digital technology, they would
    at the very least have lost their jobs.
    Suppose they had spent a couple of years
    and significant funds figuring out how
    to rig a washing machine to poison
    clothing in order to (hypothetically)
    kill a child once dressed. Or what if
    they had devoted a lab in an elite
    university to finding a new way to
    imperceptibly tamper with skis to cause
    fatal accidents on the slopes? These are
    certainly doable projects, but because
    they are not digital, they don’t
    support an illusion of ethics."
  comment: |
    Paints important art and academia as safe havens for murderers. Lanier is not one for transgression. I get that we must shape technology to human needs but should we just not go into the dark parts? Seems flawed. Then again, I remember Harun Farocki's film that concentration camps are proof that humans can do anything they want to other human beings. What are edgy artists/scientists/technologists trying to prove?Is it bad that my first thought is "that would be a good piece"? Love his definition of an ideology. Worth doing a cross-examination of art and ideology.

    Another predictable element of the
    ideology of violation is that anyone who
    complains about the rituals of the elite
    violators will be accused of spreading
    FUD—fear, uncertainty, and doubt. But
    actually it’s the ideologues who seek
    publicity. The whole point of
    publicizing exploits like the attack on
    pacemakers is the glory. If that
    notoriety isn’t based on spreading
    FUD, what is?"

    What computerized analysis of all the

    This is an extremely ambitious vision,

    the representation of ideas that are
    usually expressed in natural language

    contracts that may often be

    The distinction between first-order
    expression and derivative expression is
    lost on true believers in the hive.
    First-order expression is when someone
    presents a whole, a work that integrates
    its own worldview and aesthetic. It is
    something genuinely new in the world.
    Second-order expression is made of
    fragmentary reactions to first-order
    expression. A movie like Blade Runner is
    first-order expression, as was the novel
    that inspired it, but a mashup in which
