    Good design can help tame the
    complexity, not by making things less
    complex-for the complexity is
    required-but by managing the complexity.

    The flags flying in opposite directions reflect the invisible complexity of nature. Note that observing the flags does not lead to irritation or annoyance so much as amusement: \"Maybe we shouldn't go out today, or if we do, watch out for the wind.\" That is the way nature is: wind can sometimes move in mysterious, complex ways.

    I keep coming back to the idea of reversible logic that is hard to understand unless you created it. For example, using the same password for every site but alternating every other letter with the name of the specific site.
    
    e.g. password + google = pgaososgwloerd
    
    Slightly more complicated for the user but relatively secure. You would need two passwords to ascertain the pattern.

    The secret to coping is to take charge: stick up little reminders, warnings, pictures. Put reminders where you can find them when needed: lines, marks, sticky labels, and instructions. This dramatically simplifies what must be remembered, making it unnecessary to remember

    I may simply wish to know if there is heavy traffic along one small stretch of highway: a simple question with a simple answer. Unfortunately, in a large city, the announcer has to attempt to cover everyone's need for similar information on their particular roads. As a result, traffic reports on the radio often consist of several minutes of rapid nonstop talking, with the announcer reciting the traffic status of multiple locations, using place names that only the most knowledgeable local citizens are familiar with, describing inbound and outbound traffic-and the experience is so overwhelming that you are apt to miss the description of the traffic you care about.

    I've listened to many hours of instructions by air traffic controllers to pilots, and to my unskilled ears, they remind me of the weather forecasts and traffic advisories. The differences are that the air traffic controllers speak with a standardized technical language, with special signals to indicate to whom the particular message is directed. Thus, although the controller may issue a long barrage of instructions to several of the airplanes being supervised, each instruction is preceded by the flight number or other identifying name of the recipient. As a result, pilots do not have to listen to everything: they simply \"word spot,\" listening just carefully enough to detect when the name of their flight is called out. Once they hear their flight number, they can switch their attentive state from the secondary task of monitoring to the primary task of full concentration on the following message."

    Silhouette, field marks, posture, size, flight pattern, and habitat-those are what the experts claim are the critical features: then why aren't the books organized that way? In this particular case, the complexity comes from the technological limitations of paper books: the rigidity of the bound pages forces the book to have a single, fixed structure. "

    A good designer thinks about these things and provides clues-signifiers-as to appropriate use. This requires a special talent: empathy. Designers must place themselves in the position of those who use their designs, and then provide the information required for proper usage, but without destroying the aesthetic beauty or the functions, or increasing the cost. That's the design challenge: managing the tensions."

    Kiiiind of like following people on Twitter. Would be confusing if the people were not available, in some capacity, for clarification. Thus, the dominance of social media. Twitter as a kind of associate trail layer over the web. You follow people! That is why subscribing to facets of a person, as suggested to me by someone, is a dangerous idea.
    
    There is a difference in clarity between private annotations and those meant to be shared. Doubt that the public could follow my private scribbles. That's why social is important. Answers the question of for whom we are leaving these trails.
    
    Celebrities who don't follow anybody, only broadcast, don't get it. It's a magic mirror and you treat it like a regular one.

    The distinction between front- and backstage components of a service implies a neat separation, but this is misleading. Everything has a front and back, so each of the backstage components
    has its own front and back. Part of the bank that is backstage to the customer is frontstage to the clerk, and what is backstage to one clerk is frontstage to yet other clerks, who in turn have their own front- and backstages.

    Services don't have the glamour of products. In many cases, there is nothing to see. Service design is about procedures-which means they have to be analyzed in action.

    there are few studies of the human side

    services have focused on operational
    efficiency and, in particular, on
    mathematical modeling to optimize the
    expenses of dealing with the expected
    customer load. As a result, the

    principles for either those being served
    or the staff who do the serving. "

    One of my fundamental design rules is to avoid error messages. After all, the natural world manages quite well without error messages. To me, good design means never having to say \"that was wrong.\" An error message really indicates that the system itself is confused: it doesn't know how to proceed. It is the system that needs to be scolded, not the person. "

    The best time to learn something is just after the person has discovered it is needed. That's when the demonstrations, tutorials, and explanations are most valuable. Try to teach too soon and the result is boredom and disinterest. But catch people just as they need the material, and they are apt to be highly motivated, attentive learners. "

    the designer is primarily concerned with
    perceived affordances; the perception is
    critical. As a result, when designers
    correctly observed that some people were
    having difficulty using a product
    because they failed to notice the
    affordance, they would add visible signs
    of its existence. But, lacking the
    appropriate vocabulary to describe what
    they had done, they would say that they
    had \"put an affordance on a product\"
    when in fact they were making visible
    the presence of an already existing
    affordance. What they really were doing
    was adding a signifier. The designers
    had no choice; no other word existed to
    describe what they had done (the word
    \"signifier\" had not yet been
    introduced), so with time, the term
    \"affordance\" in design has come to
    mean something perceptible. "
