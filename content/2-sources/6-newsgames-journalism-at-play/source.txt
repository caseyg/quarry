Title: Newsgames: Journalism at Play

    Good games depict system dynamics rather than narrating specific accounts. Instead of telling a story about a particular pirate crew or hijacked freighter, the article characterizes the economic system of Somali piracy in general.\n"

    The result effectively simulates capture and negotiation, synthesizing the principles of the print spread into an experience rather than a description.\n"
  comment: "So related to Chaos. Modeling systems. An example of how even if it isn't perfect it can be useful, in this case pedagogically."
  location: "39"
- 
  content: >
    Some of\nthe subtleties that make the system rich (and make the article fascinating) are lost in the game-a situation probably attributable to the designers' desire to make the game manageable, learnable, and playable in short sessions. Nevertheless, the article provides only a disconnected, mathematical account of piracy, while the game offers a synthetic experience of the practice, one that unifies the disconnected algorithms of the print piece into a holistic account.\n"

    One of the ways games can immerse players is through a well-crafted narrative structure; therefore, Frasca suggests focusing on simulation instead of storytelling. Simulation lends itself to multiple playthroughs, a wide variety of end states, and a flexibility of values."

    Even bad taste is sometimes a good thing: in the case of editorial cartoons, crossing the line is often necessary in order to determine exactly where the line is.36 Political correctness is helpful when it protects oppressed minorities from the often unconscious denigration of the privileged, but it also tends to limit the playful expression that can elucidate unseen facets of an issue. Sometimes, generating public debate about an underexplored issue is the whole point of the enterprise.\n"

    Moving from telephone lines to satellite delivery systems, the Associated Press, the Knight-Ridder-Tribune News Service, the New York Times News Service, and the Gannett News Service began offering graphics just as they offered news stories by wire.

    At its simplest, a digital infographic might layer ancillary information visually, such that additional detail is revealed when a user moves the mouse pointer over a particular object.

    linearity doesn't do justice to videogames' capacity to represent the behavior of complex systems. Linearity pushes a singular, official version of events that discounts other possible readings. But procedural documentary games use rules to model the behaviors underlying a situation, rather than merely telling stories of their effects.21 It is procedural reality that holds the most promising future of documentary games.\n"

    even though stories like Goltz's overflow with detailed and irrefutable facts, they don't necessarily explain how a problem came to be, how it perpetuates in the structure of a social system, and what effects it has on the surrounding community beyond a few examples. Investigative reporting requires journalists to uncover the seedy underbellies of situations to derive their behavior, but the result of such reporting usually involves descriptions of specific injustices rather than discussions of the general processes that underwrite the injustices themselves.\n"

    Good investigative journalism not only asks not only the \"five Ws\"-who, what, when, where, and why-but also the procedural question: \"how.\" Good reporting should elucidate how a situation arose, not just uncover the actors, events, and consequences of that situation.\n"

    Explanations of how something works can be described in written or visual argument, by mustering explanations and examples. This is precisely what Schlosser does in Fast Food Nation, and most documentaries and investigative reports do the same. But models can also address how things work, not through explanation or example, but by showing the operation of a source system directly."

    A news story might become relevant only in the aftermath of an experience, whether it be tinged with joy, fear, desperation, or loss. Indeed, if citizens were able to experience the sensations of an experience through simulation rather than by description, perhaps they would better connect world events with the joys, fears, desperations, or losses in their own lives. Human interest games, we might call them.\n"

    This kind of reference transparency may seem more extensive than more traditional methods of citation, but it also risks occlusion.

    perhaps most critically, what does this kind of game offer that is lacking in traditional news media outlets?"

    Unlike fantasy football, in which a prediction round will always be completed by the end of the next week's game, Play the News operated on an irregular schedule. ImpactGames communicates with players by email when stories realize their outcomes."

    Play the News offers something different: not just a new way to package news in the form of a game,\nbut a novel form of the news itself. Play the News is a platform for turning stories into prediction games-games that in turn encourage potentially sophisticated discussion about the possible outcomes of an event or situation.\n"

    Creators benefit most from platforms when they choose them deliberately. Such volition has been uncommon on the Web, as media publishers have adopted it as a distribution platform without sufficient concern for what the Web does well and poorly. To cite but one case, the layout of the print newspaper doesn't fit well on a computer screen, which is better served by hyperlinked ideas that allow readers to dig deeper. Yet, most newspaper Web sites remediate the general form of the newspaper, with masthead, headlines, and jumps. Understanding how platforms work, where they excel, where they falter, and how people engage with them is a critical part of understanding the adoption of new media forms based on existing media types.\n"

    When platforms work well, they disappear into the background. Newspaper journalists don't think about the newsroom or presses that\nfacilitate the construction of their paper. Likewise, readers don't think about the wire services and trucking companies that facilitate their delivery. We don't dwell on the format of the evening news, or the operation of a Web server that delivers the bits that comprise a blog post. When platforms don't work, they advance into the foreground, where we can question, revise, or abandon them.\n"
  comment: "this is often stated problematically about design as a whole. i like the principle alot in this narrower context because it unburdens my definition of design. what can be designed on top of platforms is magic not invisibility."

    Like Play the News, fantasy sports takes data and information from real-world events, in this case athlete performance, and turns them into points in a prediction game. The raw materials for fantasy sports are statistics, data created from the exhaust of professional athletics.\n"

    RSS feeds is a great way to take advantage of an existing information structure, but too often it is only used to regurgitate that information in a new format. The real question becomes: \"What do we do with this information once we have it?\" The answer is that we need to process that information into synthetic behaviors.\n"

    Final Fantasy XII for the PlayStation 2 contains an entirely fictional world, one more like Middle Earth than Midtown Manhattan. But situations in the game take up the political dynamics of different state factions within this imagined universe. If the proper middleware existed, the game could represent relationships between neighboring states in conflict, applying an allegorical representation of current events to a fantasy world."

    The additions read as follows:\nIncreased probability of prison riot event\nReduced positive effects of legal aid policy\nCreationism policy now affects technological backwater and technological advantage situations\nOil prices now affect the chances of the petrol protests situation\nReduced effectiveness of free bus passes for retired people\nNew Pirates Attacking Oil tanker event\nLiberals are now angered slightly by citizenship tests\nStem cell research now boosts lifespan33\nThese dynamics correspond directly with headlines of the moment, but Democracy 2 interprets these events as new social dynamics, not just as isolated events."

    Democracy 2 abstracts governance to public polling and slider-based policymaking. The relationships between decisions are depicted via screens of abstract line-connecters, rather than told through stories of specific experiences. The result may be difficult for many people to understand or enjoy.\n"
